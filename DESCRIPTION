Description: It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation (and
    rotation) tests. Allowed tests: the t one and two samples, ANOVA, linear models,
    Chi Squared test, rank tests (i.e. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis),
    Sign test and McNemar. Test on Linear Models are performed also in presence
    of covariates (i.e. nuisance parameters). The permutation and the rotation
    methods to get the null distribution of the test statistics are available. It
    also implements methods for multiplicity control such as Westfall-Young minP
    procedure and Closed Testing (Marcus, 1976) and k-FWER. Moreover, it allows to
    test for fixed effects in mixed effects models.
