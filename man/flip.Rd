\usage{
flip(Y, X = NULL, Z = NULL, data = NULL, tail = 0, perms = 1000,
  statTest = NULL, Strata = NULL, flipReturn, testType = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The response vector of the regression model. May be supplied as a
vector or as a \code{\link[stats:formula]{formula}} object. In the latter
case, the right hand side of \code{Y} is passed on to \code{alternative} if
that argument is missing, or otherwise to \code{null}.}

\item{X}{The part of the design matrix corresponding to the alternative
hypothesis. The covariates of the null model do not have to be supplied
again here. May be given as a half \code{\link[stats:formula]{formula}}
object (e.g. \code{~a+b}). In that case the intercept is always suppressed.}

\item{Z}{The part of the design matrix corresponding to the null hypothesis.
May be given as a design matrix or as a half
\code{\link[stats:formula]{formula}} object (e.g. \code{~a+b}). The default
for \code{Z} is \code{~1}, i.e. only an intercept. This intercept may be
suppressed, if desired, with \code{Z = ~0}.}

\item{data}{Only used when \code{Y}, \code{X}, or \code{Z} is given in
formula form. An optional data frame, list or environment containing the
variables used in the formula. If the variables in a formula are not found
in \code{data}, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically
the environment from which \code{gt} is called.}

\item{tail}{Vector of values -1, 0 or 1 indicating the tail to be used in
the test for each column of \code{Y}. \code{tail=1} (-1) means that greater
(smaller) values bring more evidence to the alternative hypothesis.
\code{tail=0} indicates a two sided alternative. If the length of
\code{tail} is smaller than number of columns of \code{Y}, the values are
recycled.}

\item{perms}{The number of permutations to use. The default is \code{perms =
1000}. Alternatively it can be a matrix (i.e. the permutation space) or a
list with elements \code{number} and \code{seed}.}

\item{statTest}{Choose a test statistic from \code{flip.statTest}. See also
Details section.}

\item{Strata}{A vector, which unique values identifies strata. This option
is used only with \code{testType="permutation"}; parameter \code{Z} is not
considered in this case.  Also note that when only two levels with one
observation per each level are present in each stratum, the problem becomes
a paired two-samples problem and hence simplified to a one-sample test.}

\item{flipReturn}{list of objects indicating what will be included in the
output.

e.g. \code{list(permP=TRUE,permT=TRUE,data=TRUE)}.}

\item{testType}{by default \code{testType="permutation"}. The use of option
\code{"combination"} is more efficient when \code{X} is indicator of groups
(i.e. C>1 samples testing). When the total number of possible combinations
exceeds 10 thousand, \code{"permutation"} is performed. As an alternative,
if you choose \code{"rotation"}, resampling is performed through random
linear combinations (i.e. a rotation test is performed). This option is
useful when only few permutations are available, that is, minimum reachable
significance is hight. See also the \code{details} section for the algorithm
used. The old syntax \code{rotationTest=TRUE} is maintained for
compatibility but is deprecated, use \code{testType="rotation"} instead.}

\item{\dots}{Further parameters. The followings are still valid but
deprecated:

\code{permT.return = TRUE, permP.return = FALSE},

\code{permSpace.return = FALSE, permY.return = FALSE}. Use \code{flipReturn}
instead.

\code{dummyfy} a named list of logical values (eg.
\code{list(X=TRUE,Y=TRUE)})

\code{rotationTest= TRUE}. Deprecated, use \code{testType='rotation'}
instead.}

\item{returnGamma}{logical. Should be the eigenvectors (with corresponding
non-null eigenvalues) of the anti-projection matrix of \code{Z} (i.e. I-
Z(Z'Z)^-1 Z') returned?}
}

\description{
The main function for univariate and multivariate testing under a
permutation (and rotation) framework + some utilities.

\code{flip} is the main function for permutation (or rotation) test.

It allows for multivariate one sample, C>=2 samples and any regression
tests. Also the use of covariates (to be fitted in the model but) not under
test is allowed.


\code{statTest="t"} is the t statistic derived from the correlation among
each Xs and each Ys (i.e. a linear model for each couples of Xs and Ys).
This is different from the fit of a multiple (multivariate) linear models,
since the correlation does not consider the other covariates).  The test
\code{t} is valid only under the assumption that each variable in X is
independent of each variable in Y. To get adequate test while adjusting for
covariates, use \code{Z} (see example below) The test statistic \code{"sum"}
is the sum of values (or frequencies) of the given sample centered on the
expected (i.e. computed on the overall sample). \code{"coeff"} is the
statistic based on the estimated coefficient of an \code{lm}. It produces a
test for every possible combination of (columns of) \code{X} and \code{Y}
(p-values can be combined using \code{npc}). \code{"cor"} is the correlation
(i.e. not partial correlation) between each column of \code{X} and each of
\code{Y}. \code{"cor.Spearman"} (or \code{"cor.rank"}) is the analogous for
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

\code{"ANOVA"} is synonyms of \code{"F"}. Only valid for dependence tests
(i.e. non constant \code{X}).  \code{"Mann-Whitney"} is synonyms of
\code{"Wilcoxon"}.  \code{"rank"} choose among \code{"Wilcoxon"} and
\code{"Kruskal-Wallis"} depending if the samples are two or more
(respectively).

The \code{"Wilcoxon"} statistic is based on the 'sum of ranks of second
sample minus n1*(n+1)/2' instead of 'sum of ranks of smallest sample minus
nSmallest*(n+1)/2'. Therefore the statistic is centered on 0 and allow for
two sided alternatives. Despite the p-value are ok, it requires the \code{X}
to be a two-levels factor in order to compute the right test statistic. When
the \code{X} is not a two-levels factor, it measures the codeviance among
\code{X} and ranks of \code{Y}.

For paired samples (see also the argument \code{Strata} and the example
below) the Signed Rank test is performed. To perform the Sign Test use
option \code{Sign} (i.e. same as Signed Rank but without using magnitude of
ranks).

The \code{"Fisher"} test is allowed only with dichotomous \code{Y}s. The
reported statistic is the bottom-right cell of the 2 by 2 frequencies table.
The \code{"chisq.separated"} test perform cell-wise chi squared (see also
Finos and Salmaso (2004) Communications in Statistics - Theory and methods).

The \code{"McNemar"} test is based on the signs of the differences, hence it
can be used also with ordinal or continuous responses. Only valid for
symmetry tests (i.e. \code{X} is constant or \code{NULL}).  The reported
statistic for \code{"McNemar"} test is the signed squared root of the
McNemar statistic. Hence it allows for tailed alternatives.

For ordered \code{X}, a stochastic ordering test can be performed using
\code{"t","Wilcoxon","sum"} and then combining the separated test using
\code{npc}.

When \code{statTest} is a \code{function}, the first argument must be
\code{Y}. This same function is ran to observed data \code{Y} and to a
number of permuted rows of \code{Y}. The returned value must be a vector of
test statistics. Please note that argument \code{tail} must be defined
accordingly. The default way the rows of \code{Y} are rearranged is through
permutation (without strata). More complex permutation strategies can be
defined through proper definition of argument \code{perm} (see also
\code{\link{permutationSpace}}).

For \code{testType="rotation"}: As long as the number of orthogonalized
residuals (i.e. the number of observations minus the number of columns in
\code{Z}) is lower than 50, the function \code{rom} is used. The the number
is larger, the faster version \code{romFast} is used instead. Although the
latter is less accurate, for such a big sample size, it is not expected to
affect the control of the type I error.
