2.0 (2013.03.08)
- many test statistics have been implemented: "t", "F", "ANOVA","Wilcoxon","Kruskal-Wallis", "kruskal", "rank", "Mann-Whitney","chisq","chisq.separated", "Fisher","McNemar", "Sign","sum" to function flip()
- Covariates (orthogonalized residuals) and Strata parameters have been implemented in function flip().
- plot.flip.object has been ameliorated.
- minor bugs has been fixed.

2.1 (2013.04.08)
- minor bugs has been fixed.
- increased flexibility in definition of custom test statistics.

2.2 (2013.06.15)
- tests for fixed effects in mixed models (flipMix).

2.3 (2013.07.22)
- dependence to library(foreach) is now avoided.
- minor bugs fixed.

2.4 (2013.10.09)
- implemented Mahalanobis combining function for function npc().
- implemented exact solution for fixed effects in mixed models (flipMixWithin).
- global test for flipMix have been moved from flipMix to npc, which now allows for new testStat options.
- minor bugs fixed.

2.4.1 (2014.04.14)
- rom() (random orthogonal matrix) function have been (compiled) and implemented.
- kfwer options for flip.adjust() performs generalized familiwise error rate for permutation tests.
- minor bugs fixed.

2.4.2 (2013.04.24)
- minor bugs fixed.

2.4.3 (2013.06.13)
- minor bugs fixed.
- mahalanobis combining function implemented in npc()

future version
- function allpermutations now relies on the function permutation of the library(e1071) (much faster)
